# SOLVHUB
[WIP] Program for the Ti-84+ CE graphing calculator for use in varying subjects and fields.
 
A Trello Board has been created for this program to track progress.  It can be viewed with the following link:

(Fixed Trello board from private to public)

This program currently has no functional features, as the framework is being established.

Once the framework has been completed, functional features will be added.

## FEATURES
The structure of this program doesn't contain any labels/gotos, and is structured enough so the maximum 97
directories of custom content can be added anytime by the user, provided they have knowledge of TI-BASIC.
