# SolvHUB
[WIP] Program for the Ti-84+ CE graphing calculator for use in varying subjects and fields.
 
A Trello Board has been created for this program to track progress.  It can be viewed with the following link:

_(Fixed Trello board from private to public)_

This program currently has no functional features, as the framework is being established.

Once the framework has been completed, functional features will be added.

## Features
The structure of this program doesn't contain any labels/gotos, and is structured enough so the maximum 97
directories of custom content can be added anytime by the user, provided they have knowledge of TI-BASIC.

## Personal Modification
For those who want to use elements of this program, here is a visual description of how the directory system works, and the current directory map.
